# MyUsefulScripts
An repo of some scripts and tools I use daily or often (probably).

## Md5Rename (08/2021)
Rename target file to its MD5 checksum or do it on each file in an directory (does not do recursive).  
<> : Required  
[] : Optional  
Usage: Md5Rename <path> [--loop]  
Note: "--loop" can only be used when the path is an directory.

# Old stuff
Everything down here is stuff that has not been updated in a long time and dont exactly remember what they do but have chosen to include them in this repo anyways.

## Linker (2021)
Made this one to keep track of my directory junctions.

## GetCheckSum (2020)
Just got an itch to make this one.
Prints out MD5, Sha1 and Sha256 to the console of targeted file.

## G910LockDimmer (2019)
Makes my keyboard switch color to an dark red colour when the computer is locked. Flash green on login.

## ConnectionCheck (2019)
This one pings the IP 1.1.1.1 every seconds and displays the response time on an neat graph. Made it since I had some connection problems at an certain point and used this to keep an eye on my ping.

## GenerateSystemCheckReport (2019)
Create an report of all internals of the computer and save it to an file for administration purposes, also shows all the info that was fetched in the program it self.

## SystemCheck (2019)
Same as the one above, but have only an single button.

## BatteryTest (2019)
The purpose of this script was to test the battery for how long it lasted while the computer was in idle.

## ImageDifference (N/A)
Dont remember when I made this or what I used it for. Might rewrite it later.
